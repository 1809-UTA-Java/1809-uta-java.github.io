## Byte Input Streams
**BufferedInputStream** Reads a buffer of bytes from an InputStream, and then returns bytes from the buffer, making small reads more efficient.

**ByteArrayInputStream** Reads bytes sequentially from an array.

**FileInputStream** Reads bytes sequentially from a file.

**ObjectInputStream** Reads binary representations of Java objects and primitive values from a byte stream. This class is used for the deserialization of objects.

## Character Input Streams
**BufferedReader** Reads a buffer of characters from a Reader, and then returns characters from the buffer, making small reads more efficient.

**FileReader** Reads characters sequentially from a file. An InputStreamReader subclass that reads from an automatically-created FileInputStream.

**InputStreamReader** Reads characters from a byte input stream. Converts bytes to characters using the encoding of the default locale, or a specified encoding.

## Byte Output Streams
**BufferedOutputStream** Buffers byte output for efficiency; writes to an OutputStream only when the buffer fills up.

**FileOutputStream** Writes bytes sequentially to a file.

**ObjectOutputStream** Writes binary representations of Java objects and primitive values to an OutputStream. Used for the serialization of objects.

## Character Output Streams
**BufferedWriter** Buffers output for efficiency; writes characters to a Writer only when the buffer fills up.

**FileWriter** Writes characters sequentially to a file. A subclass of OutputStreamWriter that automatically creates a FileOutputStream.

**OutputStreamWriter** Writes characters to a byte output stream. Converts characters to bytes using the encoding of the default locale, or a specified encoding.

**PrintWriter** Writes textual representations of Java objects and primitive values to a Writer.
