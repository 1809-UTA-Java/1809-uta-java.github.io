# Data Structures in Java  
Java provides the Collection interface which provides a framework for several diffrent containers which will be disscussed below.  
  
## List  
A **List** is an ordered collection of elements. A user has the ability to place an element anywhere in the list. The elements are accessable by their index. Unlike **Set**, **List** typically allows for duplicate elements such that element1.equals(element2). In addition to duplicates, **List** allow for multiple null elemts to be stored.  
  
## Set  
**Set** is a collection of non duplicate elements meaning there will never exist a situation where element1.equals(element2). In addition to this, it is implied that there can only exist one null element due to the no duplicates rule.  
  
## Queue  
**Queue** is a collection of elements who in essence cannot be iterated, instead the **Queue** follows the **FIFO** (First In First Out) rule. When an element is added to the **Queue** it is placed at the back and when an element is pulled it is pulled from the from the front (index :0).
